Search Amazon Help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Hugo's Online Return Policy\nRETURN POLICY\n\n30 Day Simple and Easy Return Policy.\n\nHugo’s Online is committed to providing our customers with the best online shopping experience possible. We are committed to excellent customer service, even after the products you ordered have been delivered.\nReturn requests must be approved, processed, and the merchandise returned to our distribution center within 30 days of receipt. If an incorrect item was ordered, you changed your mind about the order or you refused the delivery, there will be a 15% restocking fee.\n\nDamaged merchandise must be reported within 5 business days of receipt of products, please be sure to report the damage as soon as possible when the package is delivered so that we can process your claim. Make sure to keep all the original packaging and be prepared for us to request photos of the damaged parcel and contents.\n\nIf your item is defective, it needs to be reported within 5 business days of receipt of products, and you must have the original box. If the product is under manufacturer’s warranty you may be asked to contact the manufacturer and file a warranty claim for a repair or replacement. If you received fewer items than you were supposed to or the wrong item, it must be reported within 5 business days after delivery or shipping carrier noted delivery.\nIf we receive your order back from the shipper due to an undeliverable address, forward on your address, insufficient address or the package went unclaimed, we will make one attempt to contact you for the correct address to re-ship your order. If we do not receive a reply within 5 business days, the order will be considered abandoned, we will restock the product and no refund will be applied.\n\nReturns must be 100% intact, in the original packaging with the UPC or barcode clearly visible on the box. Any components, manuals, registration card(s), software, cables and/or accessories must also be included. Unfortunately, if merchandise returned to our warehouse is in a non-restock-able condition, we will be unable to issue a full credit. All return requests must be submitted as soon as possible and meet the following terms for return or they will not be accepted.\n\nReturning Merchandise: To return an item, please follow these steps:\n\nContact us to request a Return Authorization Number (RA# or RMA#). Returns received outside of this process are subject to delay or refusal. The following details are required when contacting customer service:\n\n-Order ID number\n\n-Quantity to Return\n\n-Reason for Return\n\n-Your name, Company name and Daytime phone number\n\n-Your e-mail address\n\n-Please also advise us as to whether or not you would like your merchandise reshipped (if available reshipments will be subject to a delay) or credit posted to your account\n\nReturn shipping address will be provided after evaluating the issues. Return shipment address is where to ship the returning merchandize. It may go back to Hugo’s Online or to a different warehouse location.\n\nRe-package the item and affix the shipping label, as instructed. Return requests must be approved, processed, and returned to our distribution center within 30 days of receipt of the order. Any shipment arriving without an RA number on the shipping label will be refused.\n\nInclude in the package a copy of your order confirmation or packaging slip with the RA# clearly written on it. Write your RA number on your shipping label and affix to shipping carton. In the case of multiple cartons, write your name on EACH shipping label, AND indicate number of cartons, for example 1/3, 2/3, 3/3. If the shipping carton is the original manufacturer packaging, DO NOT write the shipping address or RMA numbers directly on packaging as the product must be in resale condition, with no defacing, to receive credit.\n\nMake sure you receive a tracking number for the package so there is a way to track it back to us. Also, if the order was expensive, you may want to insure the package against loss or damage. Hugo’s Online is not responsible for returned items that are damaged in transit.\n\nAll approved RA’s must include the RA number and be in sellable condition as determined by distribution center or the returned merchandise may be returned to the customer and denied credit.\n\nPlease note the following when returning an item:\n\nHugo’s Online will apply a refund of the original purchase price of the item if received back in the condition the order was delivered and within 30 days of receipt. Shipping charged on the original order will not be eligible for refund for returns due to customer error. Refunds will be applied back to the original method of payment within 48 hours of processing the return.\nRestocking Fee: Based on our return policy, any order that was refused will be refunded less our 15% restocking fee. Likewise, if you ordered an item in error, and it is returned with a Return Authorization Number, a 15% restocking fee will be assessed. This restocking fee is necessary to keep our prices as low and competitive as they are on our website. Returned products will incur a 15% restocking fee, except in cases of Hugo’s Online error. Return products must be in original condition (sealed, retail packaging); otherwise a refund may not be issued. If the return was necessitated by our shipping mistake we will pay for the return freight, otherwise freight is the customer’s responsibility.\nNot returnable: Materials returned after 30 days from date of shipment will not be accepted. C.O.D. returns will not be accepted. Altered or etched items will not be accepted.\n\nFurniture and other assembly items cannot be returned once they have been assembled or installed. Items that require installation cannot be returned after they have been installed, so please make sure the item you received is the item you need.\n\nClothing, food and beverages, pharmaceutical products, and personal safety items (including, but not limited to, first aid items, masks, respirators, and cartridges) can not be returned, except in the case of Hugo’s Online error.\nTechnology: Unopened software may be returned for credit. Opened software will be replaced only if the manufacturer approves it as defective. Due to certain manufacturer return policies some electronic items will not be accepted for return.

Items ordered from Holistic Naturals may be subject to tax in certain states, based on the state to which the order is shipped. If an item is subject to sales tax, in accordance with state tax laws, the tax is generally calculated on the total selling price of each individual item, including shipping and handling charges, gift-wrap charges and other service charges, less any applicable discounts. If tax is separately calculated and collected in connection with items ordered from Holistic Naturals through the Amazon.com Site, the tax amounts that appear during the ordering process are estimated - the actual taxes that will be charged to your credit card will be calculated at the time your order is processed and will appear in your order confirmation notification.",

But WHY was it sent by regular mail since I paid more for shipping ($35) than I did for the product?!! Plus it expires next week, so between that and temperature exposure during shipping, I'm afraid to drink it. Avoid this seller!",
