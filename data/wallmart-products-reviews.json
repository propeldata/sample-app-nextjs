        "text": "I got this boat a few months ago and I am really happy with it. Setup is easy and fast and it is just as easy and quick to store. I found that paddling was rough for me due to the distance I travel on the river. So I purchased the Sevylor trolling motor. Just take it out the box put on the prop and mount it on the side as indicated. Its a little tight for two adults but it is perfect for one adult. Just remove the other seat and you are ready to go. Once you figure out were to store your gear for comfort you'll be very satisfied with this kayak. Its tough as nails. Ive gone over stumps and fallen trees in the river and it just keeps on going. I also use a 26lb deep cycle battery and a battery power box with fit perfectly on the rear behind my seat. I use it just about every morning if the weather is good before I go to work. Well worth the money and great investment for someone who does not have a place to store a boat or kayak at home. This thing fits right in the trunk of my Altima along with everything I mentioned above to include life jacket, Portable livewell , anchor, two fishing pole which fit perfectly in the rear rod holders. I get a lot of questions about it were I fish. People are surprised when I tell them I purchased it at Walmart and the price. What gets them though is how fats it sets up and how easy it is to role up and put in the bag put in the trunk and ride off into the sunset. Love my boat.",

        "text": "I was very pleased with the quality of this product. The material is heavy and well-made, and the kayak itself is quite well-equipped. There is one drawback, however. Because an inflatable cannot really have recessed rod holders, all of the attachments (including the paddle holders) project out. That is all well and good while fishing, but it creates real problems when paddling -- it is very difficult to paddle smoothly without banging your hand or paddle against one of the projections. Therefore, if you are primarily going to be cruising, and fishing is just a sidelight, you would be much better off buying the regular Colorado model without these fishing attachments.",

The only con is that they state they are a 2 person kayak. I am 5 foot 1 inch and I cannot imagine trying to fit another person or my 100 pound dog into this kayak with me. But that's why I got the set with two, so my other half would have his own and I would have mine. \nWe had a lady comment that ours looked nicer than her 1200 dollar blow up one! \nWould definitely recommend this if you're not ready to spend on the more expensive hard ones!!",

We're not tall people. \n\nThe boat is about 8\" too short to actually fit us snugly. To even try it, I need to tuck my feet in against the sides of her seat, with my toes almost touching her leg. She needs to squeeze her feet all the way to the front. Even then, our knees are too high to paddle comfortably, and with our feet squeezed in like that, we can only sit in there for 10-15 min before needing to get out. \n\nThe far more accurate description would that the 330 can handle 2 people *snugly* with a maximum total height between the two adults of 11 feet. \n\nRE some other common questions - I think set up can be done in 15-20 minutes, once you know what you're doing. Break down is a little faster because it deflates quickly.\n\nPros - incredibly highly rated on across a bunch of kayaking sites for an inflatable kayak. You should strongly consider this kayak if you're looking for an inflatable kayak.",

I had to call customer service to ask a quick question about the availability of a seat/back and the CS representative, Jonathan, blew me away with his cheerful and helpful attitude.

I'm surprised how much weight this little kayak can hold because when my husband came back he get to use it too lol. His not skinny his over 170 pounds although we plan to buy him his own one day when I save up enough money. We love this kayak and I highly recommend this for the family. The kids easily figure how to use it by themselves. This is something my family love to do during summer the we truly enjoy.",

The one \"Lifetime\" sticker on the kayak is about to fall off.  I called and spoke with a customer service agent and although he was super nice and very apologetic he was also shocked that the company had stickers on the kayaks and not metal signs like they had in the past.  If I had to guess, all of the these 5 stars reviews got the older models and not what my poor kiddo has.  I would say \"you get what you pay for\" but it was pretty expensive.  They are going to ship an extra plug to our house, but they are back ordered and apparently they don't have extra signs or stickers to give us.  My son is pretty disappointed.",

I'm pretty heavy and I was a little scared about the weight limit showing 400lbs . On the kayak itself it shows a weight limit of 350 lbs so that was a surprise. Don't let that scare you away I was able to jump in it and so was my girlfriend to a combined total weight of about 480 lbs . Now I don't know if that was pushing it but we had lots of fun and it was very comfortable. I loved it so much I purchased a second one. Will highly recommend to all my friends . It's lightweight and fun to set up and tear down.",

The pump isn't strong enough for the boat. I had to buy a strong air pump.\n2. I was able to use the boat only twice before it started getting punctured in the bottom bed. The puncture develops at the corner place where the melted line ends. It's manufacturing defect for sure. I got 4 punctures of this kind one after the another. \n3. The puncture patch supplied in the package is not good enough. I had to buy an exclusive vinyl patch kit. \n4. while inflating, the bottom bed's one of the melted slit section just came off and the kayak was tilting up on the right. \nNow the boat is useless after using it for only 5 times. \nI wouldn't recommend this product at all after facing so many troubles within so very less usage. \nI m thinking of purchasing the hard plastic canoe now.",

Then we got right out on the lake. The middle seat does not support much. Since I have a steel rod in my spine...I need to sit more upright. So I removed the middle seat and moved it to the back for more support. It worked excellent!!! Definitely worth the little bit of money that you pay for it!!! Would highly recommend it!!! We bought two!!!",

I think it tracks as well as some lower and mid grade sit ons and sit ins that I've tried. Got to admit that the water slapping on the hull unnerved me a little when I realized I was a mile out in an inflatable but it was very sturdy and stable. I'm 5'8\" 175 lbs and there was plenty of room. If you're much taller though you may have to not use the inflatable hull insert to give you more leg room. Easy and quick to inflate. The paddle could be a little more solid on the ends but it worked fine. I also found that you can keep your legs out like a sit on top or sit in so that was nice. Overall great buy.",

Returned it do to a failed Boston valve.\n\nI purchased it's little brother the K1 so I could keep it my trunk at all times so I'd be ready whenever.\n\nI am about 6'1\" and 195lbs. I DO NOT recommend this kayak for anyone of this body type.\n\nIssues:\n1. The kayak has too much yaw. You will not track straight even though you have a skeg on the bottom. Your energy will go into zig-zaging and it's very tiring to actually cover much area.\n\n2. You must insert your legs straight and flat into the nose of the kayak or you bump into your knees as you paddle. After two hours I was very sore not being able to move my legs as they are wedged into the nose.\n\n3. In two hours I almost tipped over three times. I was in flat, calm water with no wind. It was very frustrating how tippy this boat feels. You can't look back over your shoulder (no exaggeration) without the kayak starting to roll.\n\nAll of these Negatives are NOT an issue if you of a smaller body type and are playing around in a pond or for kids vs. wanting to actually go in a straight line and kayak.\n\nI recommend the K2 instead as it's a five star. Both K1 & K2 are of excellent construction.\n\nMy K1 was returned. Hope someone finds this helpful.",

Its made from a very durable material and has multiple air chambers so it wont deflate if it is punctured.

It is the perfect kayak to solve your large group needs. Take turns of 3 and everyone gets a ride or get two and get 6 people out on the water at a time. Or bring your dog on board or throw a cooler in the back. The possibilities are seriously endless. \r\n\r\nAside from all the functionality, this kayak also stacks up when it comes to its quality, build, and design. It feels tough and strong, has a great architecture, and looks cool on the water. It is super buoyant and I have never had it capsize on me.

The beam should be a little wider.\n\nThese seats do not inflate easily, and tend to loose air soon.  Blowing air into these seats from small air valves are very difficult.... inflate - close the lid - already loose a half the air.  Manufacturer needs to replace these cheap air valves. \n\nCarrying bag is also weak.  It tore and its eye led came off in the first use.\nTotally I give 3 stars.  Do you, manufacturer, replace carrying bag and seats?",

The idea of owning one was scared to me: where would I store it while not in use? How I am going to transfer it to the water? I don't want to buy a trailer just for that activity. \r\nI never thought about Inflatable Kayak until now. With this one all my issues are addressed. Stored it just another large duffle bag and can easy fit in a trunk. Inflating it – just a simple task and I don't have to worry about trailer, parking for it and so on. It's semi-ragged once inflated so no issue here. And it's inexpensive enough not to worry about buying it and not using it enough (like some other sport equipment, happens to all of us :) ) . And if I feel that I am using it a lot and there is some deficiency with it I can always upgrade to the better one.\r\nI wrote this review for a contest but my opinion about the item is completely unbiased.",

The opening is wide which makes it easier to get in and out and provides more room for accessing my tackle box. The low profile makes it easier for me to row without scraping my knuckles. The pole holders are a great convenience.",

Their Customer Service was highlighted as among the very best anywhere. I found it easy to manage in transport, carrying, launching and recovery. Agility and true line of travel were commensurate with the skills of the person using the kayak. Comfortable with adjustable seat and foot pegs. Drain plug easy to use and kayak light enough to tilt upright for drainage even with water in the craft from rapids of cast off from using the paddles. Fun experience and extremely satisfied with products. When you have a great product at a great price and manufacturer customer service, you just have to take time to do a review of your own experience.

Customer service transferred me to one of their kayak specialist, Caleb, who was nothing short of \"GREAT\".  His database did not have the info, so we went into the warehouse to find this exact Kayak, but to no avail. \r\n\r\nSo I asked how can we think outside the box to achieve our goal, and he suggested talking to one of the engineers while I waited on the phone.  Within two minutes, he came back with the answer, 109.5\".  He told me the engineer checked via a design program, and bingo!  \r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that this info was not listed within their specifications, and hopefully will be confirmed and listed within the day.  \r\n\r\nI would have given it four stars, but Caleb went beyond the call of duty, hence the five stars.  Once I find a spray skirt that will fit a 109.5\" opening, I will buy it immediately!\r\n...and I'm not one to write reviews, but when someone shines so bright, I just had to let their customers and company know.

Of course, my only request to him was that it was a LIFETIME kayak.  LOVE their products! \r\nThis is the perfect size, paddles great on lakes and ponds, very smooth ride and easy steering.  He is 6'2\" and has plenty of leg room.  We decided on a fishing model in case our young boys want that option some day.  Back rest is well made and higher than most other brands; more comfortable!  The slim (not so deep) design makes it more realistic for transport, and the weight is moderately easy to carry.  My only wish is that it would have come with a paddle like our other Lifetime kayaks did.  All in all, we are so happy (and proud) of our Lifetime products! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",

After being on the phone with Walmart and pilot freight for a week straight trying to get this mess figured out it was finally somewhat resolved. When I got my kayak it was scratched up, black dust covered it from top to bottom, there were missing pieces, broken pieces, and random pieces that didn't even belong with the kayak! I called Walmart they said nothing they could do other then return it and send me something else and that LAST thing I was going to do was wait another 3-4 weeks for a replacement! Luckily lifetime actually STANDS BEHIND their products and is sending me replacement pieces! I will NEVER EVER order from Walmart again, not big freight anyways...I suggest no else either!!

It's not real deep and doesn't appear to be watertight, but would be great for use as a cooler.  This is a great, inexpensive kayak for a beginner!\n\nAll of that being said, ordering through Walmart went exactly as I expected.  First, my kayak arrived a week later than the expected date.  No big deal.  Just meant I wasn't going to be paddling for another week.  What really made me upset was when I saw how my kayak was handled.  It had a huge gash taken out of the side of it and the entire front portion was scratched and marked up with pretty deep gouges.  But as I was saying.. I had anticipated this.\n\nThis is a great kayak.  Please buy it if you're looking to get into kayaking or want an inexpensive one.  Just be aware of ordering it from Walmart.",

        "text": "Have canoed for years but thought a kayak would be nice to fish out of. Bought the Lifetime Payette Angler Fishing kayak and I LOVE it ! It tracks straight and is very stable. Comes with a lot of nice features: Rod holder on dash, paddle holder, two rod holders on rear dash, carry handles at each end, cup holder, removable back rest, drain plug, flotation foam in the stern. I like the multiple stationary foot rest as I like to move my feet around and not have to readjust every time.  I was glad it did not come with a paddle as I already had one picked out and didn't want an extra laying around.   \r\n\r\n The kayak was a floor model in the store and was missing a couple parts. I called customer service to order the parts and they were very nice and professional. I received the parts in a couple days and am enjoying my new kayak very much.\r\n\r\nLifetime, you have made me a very HAPPY customer! I will be buying my wife a Lifetime Tamarack sit-on and probably more for the grankids. I have told all my friends about my great experience and recommend lifetime products. To top it off, it is American Made!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDavid T.",

Set up was a breeze and only took about 10 minutes with a hand air pump. The boat is sturdy and easily and comfortably fit two adults. This is a great recreational toy and serves its purpose. I wouldn't recommend taking it in roaring rapids or extreme conditions, but a nice trip on the lake or a calm river is perfect for this kayak. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",

Read items that are shipped as it does not come with a pump or bag, I have one from another kayak. You will need two nozzles to inflate. The main three plugs are NOT screw plugs and simply push in. Tough to release if your hands are wet. The top end sections to inflate are silly and only hold a bit of air. If the small air release tubes are still in plug from shipping, remove them immediately so the inner flap closes on its own. Do not store with those tubes inserted, but keep them handy for deflation. The seats stay secure with the adjustable buckles. Dog goes in and out with ease and nails do not puncture. The walls are high and seats low so it is more canoe than kayak when paddling. The oars have a lot more weight than expected and the connections unscrew during use. Bonus, there is a drain plug to release water when packing it up. Recommend blowing up and leaving for a day or two to determine if any leaks prior to arriving at the water. Mine did NOT have any issues or require special accommodations.",

You'll be on hold for hours, send emails that don't get responded to, and spend more time pulling your hair out than enjoying this Kayak. After being on hold for one hour (after sending 3 emails to them over the span of 5 months that weren't responded to), for a warranty claim I spent hours on, that they never fulfilled.

It seemed ok, not really the fastest. The second time it was me and my husband, \nand the boat was really slow. Unfortunately,  while we were on the water we noticed that the left tube started deflating. Luckily we were on our local lake, so we paddled back to shore and returned it the next day. Overall observations,  when riding single with the seat in the middle, it becomes very rocky. So I would say, unless u r a really big person or have a lot of gear, this is better as double. Also the inflatable seats are so uncomfortable and provide no support. Also the paddles are so short for the width of the boat.  For the price, it's a nice recreational kayak to have some fun with kids.",

I used it a couple of times while away from home set up for a single fisherman.  \r\n\r\nThe material is like my larger rafts and appears to be tough enough for use on rivers.  It has the same kind of inflation points as my rafts and the pump works well.  \r\n\r\nInflation and set up was really quick and easy.  Probably less than 10 minutes to set up and be on the water.  Light weight and easy to carry down to the water.  \r\n\r\nDeflation, takedown and folding up for putting in the supplied bag took about the same amount of time.\r\n\r\nI was using this kayak on a still water lake.  On the water, this kayak worked very well.  I used the larger fin and tracking was great.  The paddle could be upgraded, but is sufficient and lightweight.  It does catch a little wind, but not bad and still controllable.  I did not use the rod holders.  There was adequate room for my gear and some water.\r\n\r\nI travelled on an airplane back home.  The entire package in the bag with a life jacket was 37 pounds.  It was a bit bulky carrying into the airport but made it home with no issues.  I will likely travel with this to other destinations and on vacations.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to using this around the lake near our house with the wife and grandkids.  Will probably use it on some of the local rivers as well.",

It didn't take much time to inflate (the process adds to the workout) and it deflates easily. When deflated it is compact, all parts fit well in the carry bag and we didn't have to secure it to the roof of the car to transport! We are looking forward to using it again.",

Calling customer service took me to someone in China who was not very familiar with the product I had and was not very helpful. We had bought an Explorer kayak that had the plastic paddle shaft connector grip break on the first stroke on one of the paddles and the only solution given was to return it to Walmart which seemed ridiculous since it was a $5 replacement part that has been \"out of stock\" on their website for months. I bought this knowing it is from Walmart and I can at least take it back there if something happens. That being said, the kayak matches up to other inflatables I have used and has the same issues such as blowing in the wind and not tracking perfectly. However, this is expected with ALL other inflatable kayaks I have used and this one is durable and holds up nicely. My skeg has NOT fallen out and it seems to stay in place very nicely and securely. The oars for this are curved and much better than the ones that come with the Explorer - they don't have the cheap plastic paddle shaft connectors that broke on the other one. I have used this for fishing and it has more than adequate room for myself and equipment when used alone. With two passengers, it still has more room than the other Sevylor Tahiti I have used in the past which is very tight. All in all the package is a steal for all of the things you get in it. You may want to order another bigger mesh bag and upgrade a paddle possibly but the value of the bundle is nice.",

        "text": "I bought the K2 Challenger on a lark after reading the reviews online. It says a two person Kayak but would be better for one adult and one child. We decided to tape the skeg on after reading that a lot of people lost theirs on the first time and was glad we did because it would have been gone if we hadn't. Overall we had a great time in it and would recommend it to anyone. We have never Kayaked before and found it to be really stable and easy to maneuver. It was really easy to blow up with the foot pump, a lot easier than I expected. The paddles although were kind of on the cheap side but gave us no problems at all. We did blow it up on a cool morning in the shade for the first time and it deflates fairly quickly when done. Thought we would have to add air to it but it stayed inflated for three days without having to add air. Over all I am glad we made the purchase.",

So far, so good.  The hand pump  is a bit of a pain in the back when filling the boat with air, but doable.  The only drawback is that it is very hard to drain the water out of after using.  Also another bit of advice, the back seat is much more comfortable because the back rests up against the back of the kayak.  I make my daughter, who is smaller and younger anyway, sit up front.  I have taken this out by myself, and it works great for 1 person, too.",

This kayak also does not seem to track as well as my hard body one. There are some trade-offs with an inflatable, but I was very pleased with this boat's performance as a lake kayak.",

I am reviewing a green/gray, two seat, single rear skeg, kayak bought in 2014. This boat is well worth the $120.00 I paid for it. The skeg WILL sometimes come off if you hit bottom when you are launching or landing and you DO need it! I drilled a small hole in it and tied a loose line from it to the boat--not too taunt or you can't get the skeg out when you WANT it out. This worked great for peace of mind. The boat is amazingly stable, quiet, and moves through the water better than I hoped--and it fits in the trunk of my compact car!",

I've inflated and deflated this kayak three times over the last three weeks and it's been a pleasure to use so far. I use it solo, and it's probably nice for two people under 6 foot.  For 2 people over 6' its going to be a little more of a cramped fit.  It's a good deal so far, we'll see how long the seams hold up to extended use.",

The pump is very efficient. Deflation and packing up takes under 15 minutes. \n\nThe kayak tracks much better than I expected, even with a 15 mph wind raising small waves on the lake.  It feels reasonably stable. The included paddle is also better than expected.\n\nThe float/footrest doesn't work as a footrest for me and my legs feel cramped when extended in the cockpit. I bend my knees a bit and bract my heels against each other. This raises my center of gravity a bit, but doesn't make me feel like I'm about to capsize.  Sometimes I put my legs on top of the cockpit.\n\nWhile on the water, I stash the bag with pump behind the seat. A gallon ziplock bag of snacks fits under the cargo net.\n\nI would not take this kayak where sharp rocks or branches might be submerged. Although heavy gauge, it is vinyl and could puncture or rip. For a lazy afternoon at the lake, it's perfect.  And if we want to take a hike, we can pack it and stow it in the trunk of our car. No worrying about thieves at the trailhead. \n\nThese won't replace our hard shell kayaks, but they will allow us to get on the water even if we  have to pack light.\n\nWe tried two other inflatable kayaks before finding these. One was very durable, but as heavy and bulky as our hard kayaks. The other was a glorified pool toy. Both cost a lot more than the Challenger K1. Neither made it out of our living room and both went back to the store. I think we're set for summer fun now.",

I've recommended this to literally anyone who will listen. I typically will inflate it a little ahead of time if i know I'm going to be taking it out and it makes it a 3-5 minute (maybe) process until I'm in the water. Fully inflating and getting in the water cant take more than 10min at the MOST.  this is really the perfect little adventure gear to have packed in your car where you can pop it out anytime you want! I've had no problems with holes or any other issues. make sure to be conscious of shallow water though as this is inflated it wont be able to take a drag over some sticks and rocks like a normal one would. over all thrilled with the purchase, great bang for your buck!",

All three have leaks, 2 of which have a leak in the exact same place (they are side by side in the picture).  The 3rd I can't even get to because it is inside at the front.  If I pour in water, I can hear and see it bubble but it is in a seam so far in I can't reach it.  I sent a message to the company and this was their response:  \n\"Unfortunately, if the leak is located on a seam it will not be repairable since the seams are heat-sealed at a high temperature. We are truly sorry about what you have been through with one of our products and hope this unfortunate situation does not discourage you from choosing Intex in the near future.\"\nAre you kidding me?  Of course it will discourage me from choosing Intex in the future.  They are unrepairable!  \nAs for the K2's, we have only used them a couple times so I'm not sure if they will hold up.",

Of course not the same glide as one made of hard material but but very good  all the same.\nSeat: decent for being inflated. clips are helpful\nDisassembly: easier if you have 20 minutes to kill to let deflate on its own Less squishing and smashing to get air out.\nCarrying case: Fantastic! no critters get inside!\nstorage space required, minimal.\nOverall a great buy for the money. completely satisfied!

I really like that I can handle this all by myself, weights about 20 lbs.  Inflation is easy.  Very stable in the water and easy to get back into if you jump/fall out into the water.  However, it is slower than a regular hard shell kayak.  When I go by myself, I take this one because I can handle it alone and I don't mind if it's a little slow.   If I go with friends, I take my hard shell kayak instead because it's faster and I have help getting it off the car.   Seat in the Intex is very comfortable and I actually use this seat in my other kayak.  Package includes seat, inflater pump, and a paddle.  Just bring a towel to clean/dry the boat.  I also keep a large tarp (about 9 foot) in the car - very useful - I inflate and deflate this kayak on top of the tarp to protect it from the ground.  I sometimes need to use a small inflatable back pillow for extra back support.  Also, make sure you fully close the inflation holes on the seat after you fill it because they can leak otherwise.   A nice beginner kayak, easy for one person to handle, comfy seat, lightweight.  Just not real fast.",

They had to find the seat because it was with another kayak and fly all over the truck.    Scupper has not been clear of all plastic circle cut out but did not leak after tested so thats good.  Over all I love it just wish they didn't have two untrained circus rejects delivering it.  \n\nSo love it\n\nCame in damaged  but not worth it returning still useable.  \n\nWAS NOT PACKAGES WITH WRAP SO HUGE SCRAPE\n\nSCupper holes not cleared of cut outs, but dont leak so far\n\nFront and rear have run marks FROM BEING LEFT WITH NO PROTECTIVE WRSP AT ALL OR TIED DOWN SO KEPT FLYING ALL OVER TRUCK.\n\nDelivered by reject circus rejects.",

My son is 6 years old and stands 4 ft tall; his feet do not reach the closest set of foot holds. There are two footholds 4 inches and 8 inches passed his reach. Which is great as he will grow into it but disappointing as it doesn't accommodate younger riders ready to learn. In calm waters its not a huge deterrent but more challenging when a stronger paddle is needed. I would like to see some straps in the cargo area as well. Even with these shortcomings I would recommend this kayak as a good starter for younger riders.",

This kayak was easy for me to get in and out of even though I am disabled, so if I can do it anyone can get in and out of it. From there the rest is easy as pie.. I was even able to put the kayak together all by myself, there aren't many steps in doing that and the pump that comes with the kayak is very adequate and quick for getting the boat ready. Several other people at the lake had the same boat, it is very popular. I love that it has a netted storage bin on the top front of the kayak so that I can bring along my drinks and other things as well.\n\nDeflating the boat was a breeze with the easy valves they have on the craft. I guess I thought it would be much more difficult to manage the kayak by myself, but it's easy!",

There are two ports to inflate, one for the bottom and one for both sides. The insert for foot stability was unexpected but was useful to keep water from collecting on top. It required a different (provided) nozzle to inflate. It is a standard port you would find on a pool float. The seat had the same port unfortunately. It is not easy to deflate as it needs manual (pinch) help. Also there is no drain to remove water that gets inside. Mine came with the oar, a small patch kit, and a bag that might not hold up, but works for now. The material seems very durable.

The stability is excellent, when swimming my daughter can pull herself on to it, and even the paddle is decently high quality. The handle on the front makes it easy to attach to my kayak with a rope, so I can pull her around if she gets tired. We attached the rope to a carabiner, so she can attach it herself while we're on the lake. Yesterday we had three little girls on it and it did fine. If you get more than one, they stack nicely. Can't believe it's this inexpensive.",

They even paddled with a friend sitting behind them.  Lightweight which makes it easy to transport and when they get a little older they will be able to carry them on their own.  The kayak is very stable, and the kids were able to jump off and get back on easily.  I definitely recommend it for people who's kids are comfortable in the water.",

We were fishing and saw a family with this and we bought it that same day. It is large with comfy seats that velcro and buckle into place. It comes with a pump and takes quite a while to fill this with air, but it is so worth it. The oars are simple to snap together and are secure. The seats were comfy, even with our life jackets..plenty of room (for two people <300 lbs total). The oars are not the most comfy, especially after about 5 minutes of rowing..they could do with better grips, but for the price, what you get is what you need for a fantastic time on the lake. We were caught by some currents and I was surprised at how nicely we were able to stay in control and maneuver with this kayak and the oars. It was smooth sailing and easy (and fast) to deflate and toss in the car. I am so pleased with this purchase. The kids had a great time and so did we.",

It's surprisingly sturdy and stabile for being inflatable. Although it's a bit of a bear to get back in the bag (tip: a battery air pump comes in handy to get more air out of the kayak), it's nice to not have to worry about buying a rack for the traditional kind. I also liked that it comes with everything you need so you don't have to buy oars separate as well.

There tends to be high plant growth hiding just at water level which tends to be hard to see at times. I was concerned about getting a hole in bottom of kayak.\nLuckily one day I had been at the area where I want to use this and came across to guys who were using the same kayak! I got to see first hand what it was like before I bought it!\n\nSo I bought it the next day! I just used it and I have no regrets. Lots of room, Max Weight is 400lbs.\nOars are ok but are not long enough. I purchase a 96 inch paddle by shoreline. Which I recommend. Easy to inflate and doesn't take long. Since it was just me and alot of camera equipment I didn't bother putting second seat in. I am tall and had alot of room.\nThe skeg even after running over a low area did not fall off. Steering is pretty good .\n\nAll in all I think it is rated the best! Well worth it.",

It comes with a case, repair kit, manual air pump and two oars that come apart for easy storage. Perfect for people that have limited space, small car or disabilities that do not permit having a hard shell kayak.\nI gave it four stars because the skeg is very long and will not let you navigate in shallow water. Not fun getting stuck and having to get out and drag the kayak. I ordered a smaller skeg off of ebay for this reason. I checked Intex's website and they offer no alternative or smaller skeg and when I called the company directly, the young lady on the other end was of no use and in no mood to answer two simple questions. She had no grasp of the products they sell, whatsoever. With that being said, for under $100 and if you can catch high tide, you're in business.",

I have used the River Run 1 for the past 5 years and consider it the best inner tube there is. I felt it was time to upgrade.\n\nThe features I like about the K2 Explorer are:\n1) The 2 hulls have separate air chambers.\n2) Its self bailing. No dumping out water\n3) All the extras that come in the package.\n4) 36 inches wide compared to the other models being 30 to 33 inches wide.",

        "text": "For the price this is a great purchase.\n\nI have to agree with other comments on this product about the paddles, they seem to be a little weak if you really dig in while rowing. The paddles are 5 pieces that disconnect to fit into the travel bag, which is a plus for storage and transportation. They should be fine for average rowing but I was rowing upstream against the current and wind and could feel some give to the joints of the paddle. \n\nAs for the kayak, my only complaint is that the seam is on the top of the tubes and my hand was irritated as they slid down the seam as I paddled. \n\nI had read complaints that the kayak wouldn't maintain a straight line but I found it very easy to navigate and maintain my intended line. It was also surprisingly stable. I am over 250 pounds and I had my daughter with me at around 75 pounds. We were both easily able to enter and exit the kayak and I switched between my daughter and younger son a few times without issue. \n\nI was a little concerned about an inflatable kayak, mainly due to durability. On the first trip out we got hung up on a submerged tree, just under the water line. I checked the kayak out thoroughly and couldn't even find a scuf mark on the underside. \n\nI had also read complaints on the pump which is included. It feels light and cheap but I had brought my electric air pump and found the air pump that is included was much faster than the electric pump. The kayak inflated rather quickly but there are several sections that need to be inflated so it does take a little time. \n\nOveral I believe this is a great purchase.",

Once on the water it performed well, is quite stable, and keeps 100% inflated. We took it out on a lake with no current but we still had wakes from the other watercraft in the area and we didn't have difficulty cutting through those. We paddled for over 2 miles the first day out and loved it! Can deflate and pack it in just a few minutes. Took longer to dry it off than to pack it! Highly recommend one!",

        "text": "At $96 and free shipping, this falls into the \"no brainer\" category. Being so inexpensive, I was a little cautious about it and did not let my expectations get too high. I got the package and all was there. I inflated it last night to make sure that it did not loose any air overnight. This morning it was still fully inflated - no leaks. Deflated it, took it to a waterfront park access to a tidal river. Inflated and in the water paddling within 10 minutes of arriving at the dock.\nIt paddled very well and was faster than I expected. I was paddling against ~ a 2 kt current and a slight breeze and was able to easily cover a good distance in a half hour. I estimate that I could comfortably do about 4 to 5 kts over a long period of time in zero current water.\nThe steg seems to work very well. I noticed that a few reviews were critical of the skeg since they stated that the steg is susceptible to coming off. I don' know if this was something that Intex did anything about , but the steg on my kayak connects VERY Snugly and LOCKS in place. I can't comprehend how the steg on the kayak that I have would fall off or be knocked loose by hitting something.\nI paddled solo, with the back seat moved up to the center as far a possible in the range of adjustment. The seat was reasonably comfortable. The back support is adequate, but not as good as a rigid kayak with a more expensive seat. My rating does not indicate that I think that it is comparable in performance to a rigid kayak, but for what it is, an inflatable, low cost, very portable boat, it delivers very well. I have not paddled any other inflatable kayak models or brands, but I would have a hard time believing that any other inflatable kayak would perform much better than this one.\nThis is my second Intex product. I also have the Seahawk 2 and have caught many fish from that inflatable boat. The Seahawk 2 rows very well.\nIf you are apartment bound without room (or budget) for a traditional boat, but would really like to get on the water, this the the boat for you!",

        "text": "Kayak is as described.  Arrived complete with all pieces, paddles, rod holders.  Its light and easy to carry and load/unload alone.  Cheaper than buying directly from lifetime.  Stable, tracks well, and a perfect little beginner fishing kayak.\n\n\nWith that being said, if you order from Walmart and the item comes via freight like these expect a shipping nightmare.  Pilot freight scheduled my appointment via email, without consulting us, whatever.  I confirmed the appointment and took the day off of work since the delivery window was 12 hours.  No call no show all day long.  30 minutes before the revert window was up I received an email stating they moved the delivery to the following day.  This was at 7:30pm.   Since they would not answer the phone, I fired off an email stating I would not be home because I had to work the next day, which was a Friday.   They said someone would get in contact to reschedule.  Monday I receive a call from pilot freight saying they only have one of the two kayaks that we ordered, and the other was lost.  After an exhaustive search, they did not know where it was.  They wanted to schedule another delivery for the one kayak they had, we declined and told them to call when they are ready to deliver both.  Again they said they had lost one, and couldn't find it.   Immediately contacted Walmart to report this and get the situation remedied.  Customer service was completely unhelpful and unwilling to help.  They obviously could not grasp the concept that one of the two kayaks has been lost by the shipper, even after a conference call with all parties.   So the wait begins.   After another week and no updates, I get a call from another delivery company to schedule an appointment on a Thursday, whatever, we set it up.   Wednesday I get a call that the driver is 30 minutes from my house. I work 45 miles away,  I managed to get off and rush home.\nNothing signed for, wrapping completely destroyed, but the kayaks were in good shape.\n\n\nIf you order these from here, don't be surprised if the shipping turns into a nightmare.\nWe receive several large freight shipments a year and have never had issues like this.  After reviewing Pilot Freights and Walmarts  reviews, I shouldn't have been surprised.    Will never order from Walmart again.",

Well super excited it was going to arrive , it finally did , and it was green !!! I was 100% sure I had ordered blue I called customer service they too verified I had ordered blue but said unfortunately they were none available and would not be able to tell me if and when . All sold out in every color but green in surrounding areas needless to say I was very disappointed \nOffered to email me when any other color was available and 15% discount which didnt even cover freight. Overall doesnt look terrible was bigger than. I anticipated Im 5ft tall not sure how well Ill do carrying it but well see",

It's reasonably priced, very stable and has plenty of room for all my gear.  Lifetime is a great company as well.  I contacted them after I unfortunately did not screw my storage cap on tightly enough and it flew off during one of my trips.  With no questions asked they are sending me a new one free of charge!

All of the reviews Ive seen on YouTube were that although its inexpensive its definitely a good kayak. Its not fast, but as an angler an leisure kayak it really fits the bill. The seat is very comfortable and the foot stays are easily adjustable. The only complaint is that the paddle that comes with it is too small.

The kayak is very stable and easily movable on the water.   The opening for the tackle storage in front of the seat isn't wide enough to insert a tackle tray, the seat would have to be lifted to access the area, but makes a good place for an extra tackle tray if not needing to access the area often. For the included paddle, it has not been used yet to review and does not come with drip rings. Overall, the Tamarack Pro is everything I need.",
